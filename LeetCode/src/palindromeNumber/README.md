# Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return <strong>true</strong> if x is a <em>palindrome</em>, and <strong>false</strong> otherwise.
<br>

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

Input: x = 121

Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.<br><br>

<strong>Example 2:</strong>

Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br><br>

<strong>Example 3:</strong>

Input: x = 10

Output: false

Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br><br>
 

<strong>Constraints:</strong>

- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
